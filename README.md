9. Copy the contents of the output file to the bottom of either `vscripts/mp/levels/mp_rr_canyonlands_common.nut` or `vscripts/mp/levels/mp_rr_desertlands_common.nut`
10. Replace the function `SpawnEditorProps()` with the contents of the output file
11. Launch King's Canyon or World's Edge, depending on where you pasted the output
